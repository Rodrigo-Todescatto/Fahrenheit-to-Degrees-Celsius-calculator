Another old .CPP file I worked on back when I started learning C++.

Old description: I was bored, so i made a calculator that transform a fahrenheit temperature to degrees celsius, it's very simple to do, i believe that people that are learning c++ only one day can do that too!""
(My english used to be bad back then)
